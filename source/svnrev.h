// NOTE: In the upstream WiiFlow repository, this header is auto-updated using
// the scripts/svnrev.sh script which is run during build time and uses the SVN
// revision as the build number.
//
// Since I am using Git and prefer manual control, I've removed that script and
// just manually update this header when I want a new build number. I've decided
// to leave the variable name alone to prevent other source code changes.
